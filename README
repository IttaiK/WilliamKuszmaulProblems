List of written methods for the Rod Cutting problem:
    In: An int & An int[]
    Out: An int
    Effect: Taking an int representing the length of a rod to be cut, and an int[] with indexs      representing cut length and values at indexs representing price for a rod at this cut length (price of 0 means this size is not sold) returns the optimal way to cut the rod in order to maximize profits. This acts recursivly with saving of values.
